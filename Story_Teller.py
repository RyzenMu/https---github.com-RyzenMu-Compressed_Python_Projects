# Did you think the most complex way of using a random module in python is random sampling? This idea cannot be farther from the truth. It is also possible to create random stories and even beyond using the random module. 

# Here, the aim is to create a random story each time the user runs the program. The story will be the same always but with little variation with the input. This is a fun but exciting python project which will work wonders with beginners to gain confidence in python.

# In a nutshell, the program will ask users for inputs such as the name of a place, action, etc. and then build a story around the data.
